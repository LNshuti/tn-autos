## Configuration

### OpenRouteService API Key

To enable isochrone map functionality, you need an API key from OpenRouteService.

1. **Obtain an API Key**: Sign up at [OpenRouteService](https://openrouteservice.org/dev/#/signup) and obtain an API key.
2. **Set the API Key as an Environment Variable**:

   ```bash
   export ORS_API_KEY='your-api-key-here'  # On Windows, use `set ORS_API_KEY=your-api-key-here`
   ```

   Alternatively, you can create a `.env` file in the project root:

   ```
   ORS_API_KEY=your-api-key-here
   ```

### Adjusting Map Settings

- **Default Location**: The map centers on Tennessee coordinates `[35.8601, -86.6602]` with a default zoom level of 8. You can adjust these settings in the `create_map` function within `app.py`.

## Stack

- **OpenRouteService** to create 30 minutes isochrone.
- **Gradio** for the interactive web interface.
- **Folium and GeoPandas** for map rendering.
- **Plotly** for data visualization.
- **U.S. Census Bureau** for population data.
